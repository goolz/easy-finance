# Easy finance

Easy finance is a personal finance accounting tool.

Years ago, I tried the tool Mint, but I thought it was bloated with features I
didn't care about, and too slow for answering basic questions.

So I wrote my own tool. My partner and I use it for keeping track of our
finances on a daily basis, and it has been a complete success.

This tool may be useful to others, so here are the sources and instructions to self-host.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the easy-finance repository

```
git clone https://github.com/nviennot/easy-finance.git
cd easy-finance
```

### 2. Initialize settings

```
cp with_env.template.sh with_env.sh
```

* Edit the `with_env.sh` and set a password (replace the `XXX`).

### 3. Setup a Plaid account

Plaid is used to retreive all the bank data.

* Go to [plaid.com](https://plaid.com)
* Register for a new account. We will be using a free development account that
  allows up to 5 linked banks.
* In _Team Settings_ → _Keys_, Copy the `client_id`, `public_key`, and
`developement secret` into the `with_env.sh` file

### 4. Setup a Firebase account

Firebase is used to store the application settings.

* Go to [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/) and register an account
* Create a new project. No need to connect to Analytics if asked.
* In _Develop_ →  _Database_ → _Create a new Database_. Select production mode,
  and a datacenter closest to you if asked.
* In _Settings_ → _Project Settings_ → _Service accounts_,
  click on _Generate new private key_. This should download a .json file
  Save it as `service-account-key.json` in the root of the repository
  directory
* On the same screen, you should see a `databaseURL` setting. Save it
  in the `with_env.sh` file

### 5. Test and configure the application locally

You can use docker if you are familiar with it. Use `source with_env.sh &&
./run_docker.sh` and you would be all set. Alternatively, proceed with the
following steps.

* Run the following in the repository directory

```
yarn install
source with_env.sh
npm run dev
```

* This should lunch a webserver. [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
  should show a login page
* Use the password from step 2 to log in. You should see the account page

### 6. Configure bank accounts

Configure accounts to your liking. Below shows a screenshot of what to expect.
Once configured, click on _Save_ which takes you back to the list of transactions.
